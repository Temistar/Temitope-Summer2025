# Quantum Computing & AI Education – Workshops, Courses & Outreach (2021–2025)

Over the last four years, I’ve been deeply committed to making Quantum Computing and AI accessible to students and educators—across different levels, regions, and disciplines.

### 👩🏽‍🏫 Key Teaching & Workshop Highlights

- **2021–2022 (Nigeria)**  
  Designed and delivered a series of foundational **Machine Learning workshops** both online and in-person for early-career professionals and students. These workshops laid the groundwork for hundreds of learners across STEM Zone Nigeria and affiliated communities.

- **2023 (Cleveland, Ohio)**  
  Led **introductory quantum computing workshops** for high school students and educators through a collaboration with **Cleveland State University, Cleveland Metropolitan School District**, and the **Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute**.  
  → Taught concepts like qubits, superposition, gates, and simple circuits using Qiskit  
  → Provided hands-on training to STEM educators to help them integrate quantum into their curriculum

- **2024 (Spring – CSU)**  
  Co-designed and taught the **first Quantum Machine Learning (QML) course** at Cleveland State University. This course, offered again in **Spring 2025**, helps students explore hybrid models and quantum data encoding using Qiskit and Pennylane.

- **2024 (Summer – Cleveland)**  
  Delivered an extended **Quantum + Machine Learning workshop** for high school students, combining foundational quantum computing with practical AI demos to spark early interest in STEM research.

- **2024 (Fall – CSU Qiskit Fall Fest)**  
  Led a multi-week quantum computing workshop series under the **Quantum Computing Club** at CSU, which I co-founded. The workshops were part of the global **IBM Qiskit Fall Fest**, and drew participation across disciplines.

Across all these programs, my focus has been on:
- Creating inclusive and engaging content  
- Simplifying technical concepts without losing depth  
- Empowering students—especially from underrepresented backgrounds—to see themselves in quantum and AI research

My workshops and courses combine **hands-on coding**, **interactive simulations**, and **real-world applications**—whether for a classroom in Nigeria, a university lab in Cleveland, or a virtual room full of first-time learners.

→ Slide decks, notebooks, and teaching artifacts will be added soon.
